🌸 Tableau Project README
Impact of Online Reviews on Sales – Amazon Review Storytelling Dashboard
✨ Project Overview

This Tableau project explores how online customer reviews influence consumer trust, purchasing decisions, and potential sales outcomes. Using a dataset of Amazon product reviews, the analysis focuses on review sentiment, rating distribution, trustworthiness indicators, and recurring complaint themes.

The purpose of this dashboard is to transform raw review data into clear, actionable insights that businesses can use to improve product performance and customer satisfaction.

📊 Dataset Used

The dataset contains Amazon review information, including:

Star ratings (1–5)

Review summaries and text

Helpfulness votes (numerator/denominator)

Review timestamps

Product and user identifiers

⭐ Key Visualisations Included
1. Star Ratings Distribution

Displays how reviews are spread across rating levels, highlighting overall satisfaction trends.

2. Sentiment Breakdown (Positive / Neutral / Negative)

A calculated sentiment category was created using review scores to show emotional tone and customer perception.

3. Helpfulness by Rating

Helpfulness percentage was calculated to measure which reviews are considered most influential and trustworthy by other consumers.

4. Top Negative Review Themes

Instead of an unclear word cloud, the dashboard identifies the most frequent negative review summaries, revealing the strongest drivers of dissatisfaction.

5. Average Rating Trend Over Time

Tracks how customer satisfaction changes over time, offering insight into consistency and long-term brand performance.

📖 Storytelling Structure

A Tableau Story was created to guide viewers through the analysis in a logical narrative flow:

Overall rating landscape

Customer sentiment patterns

Key negative complaint themes

Trust and review influence (helpfulness)

Rating stability over time

Final business recommendations

This step-by-step storytelling approach ensures the dashboard communicates not only data, but meaning and business impact.

✅ Key Insights & Business Recommendations

Positive reviews dominate, but recurring negative themes still strongly shape consumer trust.

Reviews with extreme ratings tend to receive the highest helpfulness votes, meaning they influence buyers most.

Common complaint themes (quality issues, dissatisfaction, refund concerns) represent clear improvement opportunities.

To improve sales outcomes, sellers should:

Strengthen quality control

Respond proactively to negative feedback

Encourage detailed and helpful customer reviews

Use sentiment monitoring as an early warning system

🌷 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how storytelling with data can convert online review information into valuable insights for decision-making. By combining sentiment analysis, trust metrics, and thematic complaint tracking, the dashboard provides a clear picture of how reviews impact consumer behaviour and business success.
